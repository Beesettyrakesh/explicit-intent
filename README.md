# In this repo we will see how to use explicit intent.
Intent is used when we want to take the user from one activity to another activity, that activity can be in our app or in another app.
There are 2 types of intents.
1. Implicit intent - An implicit intent specifies an action that can invoke any app on the device able to perform 
the action. Using an implicit intent is useful when your app cannot perform the action, but other apps probably 
can and you'd like the user to pick which app to use.
2. Explicit intent - An explicit intent is one that you use to launch a specific app component, such as a 
particular activity or service in your app.
